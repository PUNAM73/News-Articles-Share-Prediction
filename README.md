# News Articles Share Prediction

This project, *News Articles Share Prediction*, is focused on predicting the popularity of news articles based on various features such as content, keywords, and metadata. Using machine learning models, this project aims to help identify factors that contribute to a news article’s popularity, allowing journalists, marketers, and analysts to optimize content for higher engagement.

## Project Overview

With the massive amount of content available online, it can be challenging to predict which articles will receive high shares and engagement. This project leverages data analysis and machine learning to predict the number of shares a news article is likely to receive. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Features

- *Data Preprocessing:* Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* Explore patterns and relationships between features and the target variable.
- *Feature Engineering:* Engineer relevant features to improve the predictive power of the model.
- *Model Training:* Train various machine learning models, such as linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting.
- *Model Evaluation:* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

## Technology Stack

- *Programming Language:* Python
- *Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- *Environment:* Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/PUNAM73/News-Articles-Share-Prediction.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd News-Articles-Share-Prediction
   
3. Install the required packages:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Open the project in *Google Colab* or *Jupyter Notebook*.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to news articles, such as:
- *Content features:* Keywords, length of the content, subject category
- *Metadata:* Day of the week, publication time
- *Engagement metrics:* Number of comments, shares

(Please add any source information or link to the dataset here if it's publicly available)

## Usage

1. *Open the Jupyter Notebook* or *Google Colab* file provided in the repository.
2. *Run the data preprocessing cells* to clean and preprocess the dataset.
3. *Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)* to understand feature distributions and correlations.
4. *Train and evaluate models* using the training and evaluation cells. You can try different models and tweak hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Results

After training and testing several machine learning models, the project evaluates model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared. The results show which features are most influential in predicting article shares and highlight the effectiveness of each model.

## Future Work

- Implement deep learning techniques for improved prediction accuracy.
- Test with additional datasets to validate model performance on varied content types.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
