News Articles Share Prediction
This project, News Articles Share Prediction, is focused on predicting the popularity of news articles based on various features such as content, keywords, and metadata. Using machine learning models, this project aims to help identify factors that contribute to a news article’s popularity, allowing journalists, marketers, and analysts to optimize content for higher engagement.

Project Overview
With the massive amount of content available online, it can be challenging to predict which articles will receive high shares and engagement. This project leverages data analysis and machine learning to predict the number of shares a news article is likely to receive. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore patterns and relationships between features and the target variable.
Feature Engineering: Engineer relevant features to improve the predictive power of the model.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models, such as linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Environment: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
Installation and Setup

Results
After training and testing several machine learning models, the project evaluates model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared. The results show which features are most influential in predicting article shares and highlight the effectiveness of each model.

Future Work
Implement deep learning techniques for improved prediction accuracy.
Test with additional datasets to validate model performance on varied content types.
Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
